								<p><b> Programming Language Instructor </b> - Busan, South Korea. I develop comprehensive course materials in R and Python. The coding course program includes 100 coding projects ranging from beginner to advanced levels. These projects are crafted to teach students new coding syntax and practical skills through hands-on experience. Then I analyze student performance and provided targeted feedback to improve learning outcomes. I work in diverse environment so I collaborate with cross-functional teams to refine and enhance course content. </p>
								<p><b>AI Researcher specializing in Computer Vision</b> - Ferdowsi University.  I led research and development projects focused on object detection and computer vision, utilizing machine learning and deep learning techniques. One of the key technologies I worked with was YOLO (You Only Look Once), which allowed me to achieve real-time object detection with high accuracy. I managed and processed large-scale datasets, developing and optimizing models for precise object recognition. I collaborated closely with engineering teams and researchers to advance our understanding of computer vision technologies. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>
								<p><b>NLP Next Word Prediction project</b>, I engaged in extensive data preprocessing and feature engineering, addressing challenges such as handling large text files and ensuring data quality by removing unnecessary whitespace, non-English words,and convert to lowercase text. I compared two next-word prediction methods: Markov Models and n-grams, and applied machine learning techniques, such as bagging, to manage data complexity effectively. My efforts culminated in the development of a predictive model that achieved a 90% accuracy rate, demonstrating my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights. Additionally, I created a user-friendly Shiny app that allows users to visualize prediction results in real-time.</p>
								<p><b> Object Detection in Images</b> Using Deep Learning with YOLO project involved creating a robust object detection system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. I managed the end-to-end process, including collecting and preprocessing large image datasets, addressing challenges related to dataset variability and ensuring model accuracy. I focused on developing a model capable of detecting and classifying objects within images with high precision, which is essential for real-time applications like autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and robotics. The project leveraged deep learning techniques and Python for implementation, and the skills honed included advanced image processing and efficient handling of Linux environments.</p>
								<p><b>Clustering Methods for Anomaly Detection in Big Data </b> the project involved developing a sophisticated system for detecting outliers in large datasets using various clustering techniques, including K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering, and Isolation Forest. I tackled challenges related to managing the complexity of big data by employing dimensionality reduction methods such as hashing, which enhanced processing efficiency and scalability. By optimizing the algorithms, I improved the system’s accuracy and performance, enabling effective anomaly detection for critical applications like fraud detection and network security. The project demonstrated my ability to handle large-scale data and apply machine learning techniques to deliver actionable insights.</p>
								<p> <b>An Ensemble Angle-Based Outlier Detection for Big Data</b>, I addressed the challenge of outlier detection in high-dimensional and large-scale datasets. Traditional outlier detection methods struggle with the vast distance between points in such datasets, leading to inaccurate results. To overcome this, I developed an ensemble method that combines angle-based outlier detection with dimensionality reduction techniques. By applying Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for data reduction and leveraging ensemble techniques, I improved the efficiency and accuracy of outlier detection. I further enhanced the method by using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to aggregate results from various subsets. Through testing with real-world datasets, my approach demonstrated significant improvements in identifying outliers effectively. </p>
